The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with Javascript as well as its implementation with HTML.

I will creat a simple programm that randomly choses Roch, Paper or Scissors, then compares this choise to the choise of the human imput and then  giving out a message based on who won and how.


First I have to creat a randome number then determin how to splitt it evenly (for example 1-3 rock. 4-6 paper, 7-9 sissors) and assign rock, paper or sissors to it.

next the human has to be requested to give an imput.
this imput has to be made shrure that capitalisation does not affect the recived result.

then the choice of the computer has to be compared to the choice of the human followed by the correct victory or lose message pisplay.
